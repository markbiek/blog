The intrepid CSR is busy finishing the order. After reading back the order to verify its validity, the following exchange takes place.

> CSR: Will this be cash or charge?

> IC: Actually I'd like to use my debit card. Will that be okay?

> CSR sighs and presses the "charge" button

> CSR: That would be perfectly alright. Can I get your card number?

> IC reads card number.

> CSR: And is that Visa or Mastercard?

> IC: It's a debit card.

CSR inserts gun into his mouth. Makes note that IC will be next.
