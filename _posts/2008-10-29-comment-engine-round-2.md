The basic Comment functionality seems to be working on this site (not
than anyone has actually left any real comments yet).



## Working with the Users API



I'm in the midst of working on an admin page for myself so I can delete
comments, add site API keys, etc. This lead me towards dealing with
authenticating admin users. Of course, Google has this all taken care of
already thanks to the [Users API][].



Here's the code for handling the admin page for the Comment Engine:




~~~~ {.python name="code"}
class AdminPage(webapp.RequestHandler):    def get(self, action):        if action == 'logout':            self.redirect(users.create_logout_url('/admin/'))        user = users.get_current_user()        if user:            if users.is_current_user_admin():                self.response.out.write('I am an admin!')            else:                self.response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'text/plain'                self.response.out.write(user.email() + ' is not a valid Administrator');        else:            self.redirect(users.create_login_url(self.request.uri))
~~~~



Pretty easy, huh?



Here's how it works



1.  Handle the URL **/admin/logout** by logging out the current user
    

    -   The user is redirected back to the admin page after logout

2.  If we're not logging out, grab the current user and see if it's
    actually a valid object
3.  If the current user isn't a valid object, redirect to the login url
    

    -   This hands the user off to logging into Google Accounts which
        means that Google is handling all of the annoying stuff with
        account creation/management.
    -   After they log into Google Accounts, they come right back to the
        admin page

4.  Once the user is logged in, check to see if they're an Admin for the
    application
    

    -   Again, Google handles this via the **Developer** section of the
        [AppEngine][] application configuration page.
    -   You just add a list of Google Accounts that are allowed to
        administrate the application.



And, voila! I have an admin page that, currently, only I have access to.



## Weirdness with Indexes



I did run into one bit of strangeness related to [Indexes][].



I've been doing development on a couple of different machines (a desktop
& a laptop). I'd noticed the **index.yaml** file but hadn't really paid
much attention to it since it seemed to be auto-generating what it
needed and I wasn't having any issues.



Until last night.



Suddenly, out of no where, a bunch of my previous GET queries started
throwing **NeedIndexError** exceptions.



I spent some time poking around and noticed that my application config
on [appgengine.google.com][AppEngine] only listed one Index for the
application while my local copy of **index.yaml** actually had 4
auto-generated Indexes listed.



I did another update to send my local copy of the app up to the App
Engine but that didn't seem to be updating the Indexes on the live app.



In the end, **I had to manually move all of my Index out of the
AUTOGENERATED area of index.yaml.**



Once I'd done that and resynced the app, everything started working
again.
