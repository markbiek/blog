I'm going to try this again.

I haven't been as diligent about updating the [geek blog.][] as I'd like
and I, for some reason, feel weird about mixing the programming stuff
with this. My hope is that writing here will help me write there which
will send me back over here into a feedback loop of annoying content
that no one will really have any interest in at all.

So here goes.
