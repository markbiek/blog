My first online experience was in about 7th grade (1988?). My mom owned
a medical transcription business and she had recently switched from
electric typewriters to dual-floppy drive Sony computers. I don't know
the exact model information but they were a few models down the line
from this sort of thing:

![Sony Word Processor][]

The ones I used looked more of a ripoff of the original Macintosh. There
was a floppy with the "operating system", another floppy with the word
processing program, and another that turned out to be a communications
program because the machine had a built-in modem.

I was at the office one day after school and my mom randomly showed me
how to dial into a [BBS][] somewhere in the bay area. I remember being
instantly enthralled by the idea that we were connected to another
computer hundreds of miles away, even if there wasn't anything
particularly interesting happening on the other end. This simple
show-and-tell changed something in me and I never looked at computers
the same way again. A computer wasn't just something you sat alone in
front of, but a doorway to a different place.

The BBS scene in Redding, CA was pretty sparse at the time and I wasn't
allowed to call southern CA very often so my online access was limited
for the next year or so. Then we got our first Macintosh with 2400bps
modem. I found a few local BBSes that I started to frequent and was soon
spending far too much time playing TradeWars and downloading hax0r text
files. I downloaded a wardialing program and tied up our spare phone
line for days canning our entire area code. I even found a few
interesting places (One was a plastics company that was running some
flavor of Unix, not that I had any idea what Unix was at the time). Of
course I was too much of a wuss to actually do anything with all of this
new knowledge. But I felt like such a badass just having these folders
of information. I had, at my fingertips, more power than all of the
people who were torturing me on a daily basis. Oh, how I loved that
bright ANSI Art world. I still dream about it sometimes. There I am,
sitting in the dark of my room, staring at a screen like this.

Despite the growing number of places I could dial into locally, I still
managed to rack up a number of large phone bills calling places like the
[Temple of the Screaming Electron][] and [Robert Carr's][] Private Idaho
BBS.

Carr was the genius behind such wonderfully offensive Mac program as
MacJesus - Your Personal Savior on a Floppy Disc.

While researching for this post, I discovered that my terminal program
of choice (Zterm) is actually still [being developed](https://homepage.mac.com/dalverson/zterm/). There's even an OSX
version.

![ZTerm][]

It was an amazing little program that you could script to automatically
dial into differents sites, download files, and logout.

I went through a number of handles in those days

-   Erotic Jesus
-   Dupree
-   Jane
-   A Butterfly's Dream (ABD)
-   Antelope Love Fan
    
    



I've been using the last one ever since.

And now I'll leave you with a piece of writing that probably had more
affect on me than anything else growing up.
