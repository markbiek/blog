We're going to talk, briefly, today about the [Alternative PHP Cache
(APC)][] which can be used to cache data at the **application** level.
Keep in mind that this is very different than storing data in the
SESSION object (which disappears when the session is over) and is only
accessible by that particular SESSION. Data stored in the APC lasts
indefinitely if you haven't specified a TTL (time-to-live) and is
accessible across all SESSIONS.

Using it is pretty simple. Plop data into the cache by calling
**[apc\_store()][]**, get the data back out by calling
**[apc\_fetch()][]**, and remove it from the cache by calling
**[apc\_delete()][]**.

You'll also notice the function **[apc\_add()][]** which does the same
thing as **apc\_store()** except that **apc\_add()** will ***not***
overwrite an existing value in the cache.

In general, you can put just about any kind of object into the cache.
The only exception is an array of objects, in which case you need to
wrap the array with the [ArayObject wrapper][].

So what's it good for?

Technically, you can use it to [pre-compile][] a PHP file into a bytcode
to speed up execution (although I haven't used that functionality
personally).

I mainly use it for caching the results from large database queries so I
don't have to keep hitting the database over and over.

For example, here's the [profiling information][] for a random test
database query:

![image][]

And here's the profiling info for pulling that same information from the
cache:

![image][1]

As you see, a decent amount of speed-up for not very much extra work.
