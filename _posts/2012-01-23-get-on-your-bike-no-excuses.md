Don’t worry about how your bike looks.

Don’t worry about your clothes.

Don’t worry about the weather. If it’s cold, you’ll warm up again. If
it’s wet, you’ll get dry again.

Just get on your bike and ride it. Go as fast as you can. Or as fast as
you want to.

You don’t need headphones.

Listen to the sounds of the world. The wind whistling in your ears. The
sound of your heart pounding in your chest.

If you see someone else on a bike, wave to them.

Don’t worry about mountain bike, road bike, fixie, used, new, fancy
brand, department store bike.

People should wave to other people on bikes.

We are brothers and sisters of the wheel and should acknowledge each
other as such.
