Slug: the-most-uncomfortable-training-session-ever

Many moons ago, I was a developer for a market research company. Most of
what I did involved data processing/analysis in SAS and a little bit of
Python & PHP for online surveys.

Occasionally, though, I’d have to attend focus groups and handle
whatever software we were using to gather responses.

At one point, one of our larger clients wanted us to take over doing
their focus groups using an [Audience response system][].

If you don’t what that is, basically you have a presenter showing a
series of slides with pictures, videos and questions. The audience
members are asked a question on each slide, usually multiple choice or
rating things on a scale from 1 - 10.

Each audience member has a little remote control that they use to punch
in their responses.

There’s a box somewhere in the room that captures the responses and
pipes all of the data into a piece of software that generates results in
real-time.

Clients love this sort of thing because they can sit in the back room
and get instantaneous results from the questions they’re asking.

At any rate, it was decided that I was going to be the person to become
the expert on the system this client wanted us to use. The client had
already purchased the entire system so all I had to do was pick it up
and get trained on it.

Simple enough, right? But there was one little wrinkle.

This client was *already paying another company* to handle all of their
audience response jobs.

So they were taking the business away from this company and giving it to
ours.

And guess who I had the equipment I needed to pick up? And also guess
who was going to be handling my training session?

The very same company that was losing a big account because of us.

I drove the two hours to the training site to a very chilly reception.
They set me up in a conference room and dragged all of the boxes of
equipment in.

Training consisted of a few printouts, a very rough overview of the
system and then they left me alone. I got most of figured out on my own
but I did have to wander around the office to find someone to answer a
few questions.

When lunchtime rolled around, everyone in the office went off to eat.
Understandably, I was not invited and ended up finding a decent Chinese
place a few miles away.

I spent a few more hours in the afternoon getting the system fine-tuned
before I packed up and headed for home.

We got a couple of years of use out of the equipment. My understanding
is that the whole thing is now done using iPads.
