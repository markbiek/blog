So I was one of the people who got all up in arms about Instagram's new
TOS. I initially tried just deleting all of my pictures but, in the end,
I deleted my account.

Honestly, I should've given it a couple of days to think about. As we
know, Instagram has backed off some of the language I objected to (for
now :) ).

Plus, while I haven't missed Facebook since I got off that, I really do
miss Instagram.

So I've signed up again under a new username. And this will be a little
lesson to me to not be so hotheaded.
