Today was the coldest weather I've ever ridden in. Here are some pertinent statistics:

### Temperature: 0&deg;F

### Distance: 5.1mi

### Elapsed time: ~21mins

### Number of shirts worn: 3 _(smart wool base-layer, short-sleeve cycling jersey, long-sleeve cycling jersey)_

### Number of outer-layers worn: 3 _(fleece pullover, cotton hooded sweatshirt, windbreaker)_

### Number of pairs of socks worn: 2 _(dryfeet cycling socks, smart wool long socks, plus wind-proof shoe-covers)_

### Number of pairs of gloves worn: 2 _(wool gloves covered by fleece lobster-claws)_

### Number of hat/face things worn: 3 _(cotton balaclava, fleece hat, wool scarf)_

### Number of times I had to stop to scrap ice off my glasses: 4

### Number of strange things that got ice on them: 2 _(my eyelashes and the hairs inside my nose)_

### Number of times I swore out loud at the wind: **A LOT**

It wasn't an easy ride but it wasn't the most uncomfortable ride ever either. Of course, I did wear just about every piece of warm gear I own.
