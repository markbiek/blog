So you got your first programming job, now what?

* Ask a million questions. 
* Don't get too hung up on doing things the "right way" (But make sure to go back and fix things once you figure out what the "right way" is).
* Don't suffer in silence. Ask for help as early and often as you can. You'll more damage by hiding the fact that you're struggling.

(Looking at it, this is good advice for all of us)
