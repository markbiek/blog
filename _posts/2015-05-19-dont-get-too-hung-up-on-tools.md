I'm volunteering as a mentor for a Code Louisville Front-End Web Development course. It's fun to meet people from all different walks of life with different levels of experience.

To put myself back in the beginner mind.

But it's interesting how much of the online discussion is centered around tools.

Which editor? Which plugins? etc

And I get it. Tools are fun. Mastery of a powerful tool can do so much for your productivity.

But ultimately you can get work done with any tool.

Tools don't matter as much as a deep understanding of what you.re learning.

Don.t let the search for the perfect tool distract you too much.
