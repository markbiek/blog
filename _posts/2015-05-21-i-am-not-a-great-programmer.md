I am a middle-of-the-road programmer.

I don't think I'm a 10x programmer. I am not changing the world. I never invented a programming language or wrote a really amazing piece of software that everyone knows about.

So I have to make up for it other ways.

* I write decent code (mostly).
* I document things.
* I accept criticism.
* I'm always learning.
* I can stay organized in a large project.
* I work well with people, especially non-technical people.
* I can be an advocate for a talented team member who is being overlooked or mentor Junior developers.
* I can deal with assholes without getting upset.
* I can get things done. If there is a roadblock or someone is stuck, I can generally get things moving again.

I'm going to bring value to the table in whatever way I can.
