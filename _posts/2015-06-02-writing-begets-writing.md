Writing is easy.

Starting to write something is hard.

But writing, itself, is easy.


Once you're started, it's hard to stop. The ideas come faster than you can even get them down and you start worry that maybe good stuff is getting lost.

Don't worry, there's always more. You are an infinite well.
