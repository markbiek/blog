Agnes Flannegan Chapel, Lewis & Clark College

I was 13 the first time I heard an Alan Ginsberg poem.

I was attending the Fir Acres Writing Workshop at Lewis & Clark College ([which I've written about before](/2009/02/the-shapening)) and a group of us were wandering around campus.

We discovered that the Chapel was unlocked so went inside.

My friend Nathan took the pulpit and started reading Allen Ginsberg's [America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_(poem)).

We lay on the floor as his voice boomed off the wooden rafters, and I was hooked.

I read [Howl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howl_(poem)) over and over. I cried when I read [Kaddish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaddish_(poem)) for the first time.

And I can still hear Nathan's voice echoing out in the holy room in the middle of the night.
