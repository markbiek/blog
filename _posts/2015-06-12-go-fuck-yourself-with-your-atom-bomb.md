Agnes Flannegan Chapel, Lewis & Clark College

I was 13 the first time I heard an Alan Ginsberg poem.

I was attending the Fir Acres Writing Workshop at Lewis & Clark college, which Ive written about before and a group of us were wandering around campus.

We discovered that the Chapel was unlocked so went inside.

My friend Nathan took the pulpit and started reading Allen Ginsbergs America.

We lay on the floor as his voice boomed off the wooden rafters, and I was hooked.

I read Howl over and over. I cried when I read Kaddis for the first time.

And I can still hear Nathans voice echoing out in the holy room in the middle of the night.
