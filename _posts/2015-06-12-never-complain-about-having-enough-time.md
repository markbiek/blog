People are constantly saying, Oh, I wish I could do xyz but I just don't have enough time.

Or I'm behind on xyz. There just wasn't enough time.

And I get it. Everyone has things going on.

You work full-time, you're married, you have kids, whatever it is.

The thing is, you have time for the things that you make a priority. You would've had enough time to do xyz if youd made it a priority.

But you didn't. You chose to do other things instead, which is perfectly fine.

But you don't get to complain about not doing xyz any more.

You either decide how committed you are to xyz and do it.

Or you let it go.
