There is a book called [Seventh Son](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Son_(novel)) by Orson Scott Card. The main character is a boy named Alvin who is a Maker.

Theres a mystical aspect of the story that I wont get into but the main take-away is that Alvin must create.

To build.

To make.

During one scene, Alvin is sitting in a field having a conversation. Even during this mundane moment, Alvin is weaving little bug baskets out of grass.

His inability to stop making means he the only person in a position to fight [The Unmaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unmaker), a supernatural force that is entropy combined with an evil desire.

In the real world, The Unmaker manifests itself as boredom, loneliness, burnout, hopelessness.

And the only way to fight it is to make things.

Create art. Build things out of wood. Write stories or code.

Just create something every day. It doesnt have to benefit anyone else. It just needs to be a quick reminder of your own humanity.
