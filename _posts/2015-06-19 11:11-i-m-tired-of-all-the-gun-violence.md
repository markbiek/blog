[Multiple Weekend Shootings In Louisville Leave 4 Dead, 2 Injured](http://www.lex18.com/story/28054027/multiple-weekend-shootings-in-louisville-leave-4-dead-2-injured)

[Three dead in two West Louisville shootings](http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/crime/2015/02/25/three-dead-west-louisville-shootings/23983079/)

[1 dead, 2 critically injured in shooting near Shively](http://www.wave3.com/story/28051871/update-1-dead-2-critically-injured-in-shooting-near-shively)

It just goes [on and on and on](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=louisville%20shootings).

And now theres the s[hooting in Charleston.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Charleston,_South_Carolina_shooting)

I'm sick of it and I want it to stop. This country has too many guns and theres no reason for any of it.

Fuck the Second Amendment. Its time and place is long gone.

Home defense? Its b[ullshit.][(http://www.hsp](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/17/guns-self-defense-study_n_7608350.html)h.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/gun-threats-and-self-defense-gun-use-2/) Way more likely that you or someone you love will be killed accidentally or on purpose with that gun.

Are you a conspiracy nutjob who wants to be armed in case of a revolution? Thats bullshit too. An insurrection isnt going to be fought with the weapons of private citizens.

More guns equals less crime? Even [more bullshit](http://www.armedwithreason.com/less-guns-less-crime-debunking-the-self-defense-myth/) based on misinterpretation and outdated statistics.

Something simple to use hunting for food might be OK, but I want all the rest of it gone.

Take away the tactial accessories. Take away high capacity clips. Take away the handguns. Take away the assault rifles.

Lets learn a lesson from the r[est of the world.](http://www.humanosphere.org/science/2014/03/visualizing-gun-deaths-comparing-the-u-s-to-rest-of-the-world/#prettyPhoto)

Make it stop.
