The only notification I have enabled on my phone is the text message notification. Its the easiest way to communicate with the most important people in my life.

I turn everything else off.

No email notifications. No Facebook. No Instagram. No Twitter.

Nothing.

I have all of those apps installed. But I decide when I want to see whats happening.

On my work computer, I get chat notifications. Again, because thats the primary way of communicating with my co-workers.

But I have work email notifications turned off. Theres so much email coming in, itd be a constant flood of popups. I keep my email open and I check it several times an hour. But its on my terms.

In my line of work (software development), focus is key.

Communication is vital but its easy for it to overwhelm me. I dont want to be accessible all the time.

I want the power to pick and choose how and when I interact.
