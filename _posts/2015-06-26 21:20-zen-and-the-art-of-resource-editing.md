I was a Macintosh guy for a long time.

I started with the Commodore 64, then a weird Sony word processor, and ended up with a Macintosh LC at the beginning of high school.

I got tired of just games after a while and set about learning other stuff to do with my Mac  and that road lead me to R[esEdit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ResEdit)

ResEdit was a utility which let you view and modify the [resource fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Resource_fork) of an application. While the resource fork primarily contained all of the image/icon/text resources for an application, it also contained the executable code for Classic 68k applications.

I figured out how make simple changes on my own (mainly changing to text of menu items to bad words) but I was pretty limited in what I could do.

And then I discovered [Zen and the Art of Resource Editing](http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Art-Resource-Editing-Resedit/dp/0938151754).

They taught magical tricks like changing the Macintosh startup sound (I changed my to the [THX sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWkJ86JqlPA)) or even changing the startup screen.

My startup screen looked like this for the rest of high school.

I got my second Mac in college (where I met my future wife) which necessitated a startup screen update.
