I'd imagine the first time I went skinny dipping was as a child, but I don't specifically remember it.

I do remember the most glorious time though. Mid-September, 1994.

Jesus, that was over 20 years ago.

The lower campus of Lewis & Clark College, formerly the Frank Family estate, had a lovely little pool. Only about 25 feet long and 6 feet deep at the deepest, my favorite thing was always the ornate fish-shaped railings by each ladder.

I was wandering around campus in the dark, as I often did, when I came across two girls and boy standing at the edge of the pool. It was still warm out and the moon was completely full. A giant silver orb painting everything white.

The pool looked like it was full of milk.

The trio was discussing the possibility of hopping the fence to go skinny dipping and they invited me along. We clambered over, stripped ourselves bare, and dove into the cool water.

I don't know their names or if I ever saw them again.

I just remember the creamy water, blurred limbs, and the simple joy of being young.
