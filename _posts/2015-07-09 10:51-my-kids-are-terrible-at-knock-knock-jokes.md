Slug: my-kids-are-terrible-at-knock-knock-jokes

How can you be bad at knock knock jokes? Theyre the simplest form of joke on the planet.

And yet, my kids are.

I loved knock knock jokes when I was little. I had a bunch of books and I spent hours reading and memorizing them.

> Knock Knock.
> Whos there?
> Luke.
> Luke who?
> Luke, I'm standing on my head!

My kids don't do this. They just make things up. And from an avant-garde/dadaist sort of view, they're probably brilliant, but they're horrible to a purist like me.

> Knock Knock.
> Whos there?
> Poop.
> Poop who?
> I pooped on your head!

What is that?!? That doesn't work at all.

Luckily their appreciation of physical and absurdist humor is solid and they love sarcasm and wield it expertly.

I guess you just can't win every parenting award.
