I’ve spent a lot of time over the course of my career thinking about what I want in a job. The answer has varied a bit over time. But I think I’ve narrowed it down to these things.

#### I want to work with people I like.

Being on a good team is really everything. I want to work with smart, interesting people. People I can learn from and teach things to. A group that builds each other up. Life is too short to put up with drama or work with assholes.

#### I want to solve interesting problems.

Sometimes this means fixing old stuff. Sometimes it means making new stuff. Whatever is, I just don't want to be b[ored.](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/bored-people-quit/) I don't want to spend time fighting tools or process. I want to do stuff.

#### I want to make things that get used.

Is there anything more frustrating than working on something that never sees the light of day? I want people to use the stuff I work on. That’s really the only way to make my stuff better. People need to use it so I can find out which parts are useful and which parts suck.

Work environment plays a minor role. Money is helpful. Benefits, vacation, perks, blah blah blah.

But ultimately, give me those three little things and I’m yours.
