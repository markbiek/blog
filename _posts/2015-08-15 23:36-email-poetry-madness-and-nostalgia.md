Yeah, its another F[ir Acres Writing workshop ](https://mark.biek.org/blog/2009/02/the-shapening/)story. Maybe I'm a little re[petitive. So w](https://www.jamesaltucher.com/2015/08/kurt-vonnegut-the-secret-of-all-art/)hat? I'm rolling with it. Its like James Altucher said:

That thing is one of mine.

We all had temporary @lclark'edu email addresses and access to a mail client called Mailstrom that ran on the Mac. Mailstrom is something entirely different now. It being 1993, this was the first time with email for most of us.

Of course it all went completely went off the rails. Bizarre email poetry and all hours of the day and night. One kid started emailing random people and got banned from the system entirely. I think one of his emails was about his purple cock riding the waves like a surfboard.

I’ve got a stack of 100 or so of these old emails printed out that I found in a box. Here are some highlights (verbatim).

> the air is cold and smells of stone. the fire grows as the cloaked arms reach toward you, through you. can you feel them press against you in that fierce embrace as you struggle and fall. feel the blades in your back the teeth the nails as the tongues run over your blood. feel the scream inside and wonder who exactly that tiger is. the beast who dances in that night. feel the wet ground above your back as you fall into the night. feel it rush over you as your cry and slowly give in.

> VENTALATION

> keys tinkle slowly and put me to sleep. sleep will only be a piece of time wasted while we are here. we must savor our time here, it is titlating. like the paino. the sounds flood around us. then it stops and we speak. only to relaise we don’t have much longer. only eight more days. eight more days to make love to our wrds. to ventliate our brains. to be with each other, where we belong. where the blood is processed and the cheese is carbonated. where there is lots of dirt. i have found the world i wanted. i also realise we must all let this go, we all must leave.
