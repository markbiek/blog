## My heart lives in Portland

My mother gave birth to me in Mt Shasta, CA but I am not from there.

I grew up in Eureka and Redding but I am not from there either.

I traveled the highways and rivers of Oregon north, to Portland.

My soul was forged in the hallways and gardens southwest of the Willamette River.

My heart found love in Portland. It has that love wherever it goes, but it still aches for the West.

I was born in Oregon and to Oregon I will return.
