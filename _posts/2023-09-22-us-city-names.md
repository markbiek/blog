I've traveled around the USA a lot in my life and I've always noticed how many city names are re-used from state-to-state (not to mention US cities that use names from other countries)!

On a trip to Bowling Green, KY a couple of years ago, we accidentally booked a hotel for Bowling Green, OH and I started to wonder: How many unique city names are there?!?

So, today, I decided to try and roughly quantify it. I found this great free database of US cities from [SimpleMaps](https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities) which has 30,844 US cities listed in a convenient CSV format.
