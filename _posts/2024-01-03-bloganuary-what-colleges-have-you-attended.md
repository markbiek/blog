I took night classes at our local [Shasta College](https://www.shastacollege.edu/) in Redding, CA my senior year of high school. I was getting extra credits to graduate early. Fun fact, my mom studied journalism there when I was really little.

I took a psychology class and a fiction writing class. The writing class was great. I was a terrible, but prolific writer back then so it was pretty easy for me to crank out piece after piece.

The psychology class was a different story. I think everyone who's taken a psychology class has run into the problem that there is always at least one person who thinks that class is their personal oversharing time. It was unfortunate in this class because the teacher refused to do anything to reign this person in.

For undergrad, I went to [Lewis & Clark College](https://www.lclark.edu/) in Portland, OR. I've written about my path to L&C in [The Shapening](https://mark.biek.org/2009/02/the-shapening) so I won't re-hash the whole story.

Suffice it to say that L&C was pheomenal. I took tons of cool classes, fooled around a little too much, and met the woman who is now my wife of 22 years.

It's weird to think that my first day at L&C was almost 30 years ago.
