This is an interesting question because it varies so much from moment to moment.

I'd say, in general, the thing I crave the most is time alone. I don't usually get enough of it and I'm super grateful when I get the opportunity to have it.

The other thing I'll say is the espresso machine my wife gave me for Xmas. It's super easy to use and it has a great milk-frother so I can make lattes at home every day!
