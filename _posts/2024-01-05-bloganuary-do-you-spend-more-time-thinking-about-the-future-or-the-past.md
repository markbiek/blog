At the moment, I'm definitely thinking more about the future, though I'm trying really hard to just think about NOW.

I go back and forth between hope and despair.

Some days, it seems like it's all going to fall apart. The country will devolve into facism or civil war. The planet will continue to burn, etc, etc.

Other days, I feel better about things. I can believe that peace and justice will prevail. I can believe that humanity will survive and thrive.

But the best days are where I don't think about any of that. I enjoy talking around the dinner table with my family. I enjoy petting my dog. I enjoy the gentle weight of my cat sleeping on my chest.

Sometimes it's a struggle, but there's peace and beauty to be found.
