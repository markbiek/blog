I think the thing I need to work on the most is being more willing to ask for help, at least in my personal life. Asking for help at work is easier, somehow.

My default has always been to just do things myself. I _could_ ask someone to help me carry all those bags to the car. Or I could just make 4 trips and do it alone.

I have so many people who love and support me and I know the would help if I asked.
