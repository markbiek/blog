There have been many things at many different ages but I think I'll stick to two big ones:

## 1. My bike!

I learned to ride a bike when I was about 5. I started off just riding around our street but, within a few years, I was riding all over town. While I did learn to drive, getting around by bike was my primary mode of transportation, even for the first year of college.

When I look at my bike, even now, it represents freedom and self-reliance. 

## 2. My computer!

My first computer was a Commodore 64 when I was 6 or 7. I got my first taste of programming (BASIC!) not long after and have been hooked every since. What a magical device that you can play games on and create things with! 

I started [getting online](https://mark.biek.org/2009/02/a-refugee-from-the-world) in the late 1980s and that was another revelation. I could find all kinds of people like me outside of the podunk town I was living in. Then came the Web and another new world opened up.

Sometimes I get a little cynical about the state of the Internet but I can still recapture that original magic.
