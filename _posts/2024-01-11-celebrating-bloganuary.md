I currently work at [Automattic](https://automattic.com/) doing software development on [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com).

One thing we do at the beginning of the year to encourage people to write more is [Bloganuary](https://bloganuary.wordpress.com/). We give you daily writing prompts and let you go wild!

[Lots more details here](https://bloganuary.wordpress.com/2023/12/15/bloganuarys-back-baby/) including a 25%-off coupon for a new WordPress.com plan (or renewal) (our free plans are super generous too).

While parts of this site use WordPress.com, I haven't fully migrated the blog over yet. So I'll be doing Bloganuary 2024 here instead! It's worth noting that I'm behind on the prompts so I've got a lot of writing to do in a short amount of time.

Get out there, write something and share it with the world! I'll catch up shortly. ðŸ˜œ
