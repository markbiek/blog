When I was younger, I was all about online communication. I did BBS chats, online forums, email, website discussion boards, and so on. Communicating with people digitally felt so much easier.

Now that online communication is so ubiquitous, my relationship with it is a bit different. I don't have the same amount of social energy anymore so I try to spend it, in-person, with the people I care about the most.

That said, I _do_ still use a number of tools for communicating:

* Texting (for personal stuff).
* Signal (a few personal conversations. still trying to get everyone to switch from texting).
* Slack (for work).
* WhatsApp (for friends/family outside of the US).
* Email (some personal, mostly work/school stuff).
* Mastodon (not heavily).
