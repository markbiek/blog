I got rid of the set of encylopedias we had. I bought them on eBay for when my kids were younger.

Now I can probably get rid of those college text books I've been carting back and forth across the country for almost 30 years.

Harder is going to be de-cluttering my digital life. I'm something of a digital packrat.

I still my mbox file from college. I have old BBS text files from the early 1990s. I've got hundreds of gigs of photos that could definitely get paired down.

But disk space is cheap so I can put all that off for a while!
