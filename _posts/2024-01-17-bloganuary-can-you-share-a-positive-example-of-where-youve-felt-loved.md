I'm a fortunate man. I feel so loved by so many every single day.

But one really wonderful example I think about a lot was when I had COVID last Fall. I kept rushing around trying to do things when I should've been in bed and then my wife sent me this wonderful text.

> Take a sick day today and give yourself some grace. You and your children are happy, healthy, safe & loved. Breathe easy.

I read that text and immediately burst into tears as I felt all of this weight dissapate from my body. I'd been holding so much tension from my expectations of myself and I didn't even realize it.

So I went to bed and slept for 15 hours.
