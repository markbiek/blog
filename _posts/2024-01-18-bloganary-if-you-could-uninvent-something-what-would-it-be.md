If I could uninvent something, it would 100% be social media.

Like many of us who got to experience the beginning of the web and the Internet coming into our day-to-day lives, I thought ubiquity of the Internet would change everything for the better. I thought access to the worlds knowledge would improve everyone and make society better.

I was obviously _super_ wrong about that. Lies spread so much more quickly than truth. Our data is for sale to the highest better. Privacy is rapidly disappearing and most people don't care.

No where is all of the above more prevalent than on social media. Our feeds are careful controlled to keep us enraged and scrolling at all times.

I want it all to go away.
