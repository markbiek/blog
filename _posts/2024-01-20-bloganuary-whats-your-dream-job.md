This one's easy! It's my current job at [Automattic](https://automattic.com/).

This place is amazing. I get to work with amazingly smart and kind people every day. I get to build things all the time. The things I build get used by tens of thousands of people every day. I get to challenge myself and learn new things all the time. I get to have a direct impact on the work we choose to do.

And the perks! So many perks like an amazing benefits package, home office budget, international travel for meetups, and on and on.
