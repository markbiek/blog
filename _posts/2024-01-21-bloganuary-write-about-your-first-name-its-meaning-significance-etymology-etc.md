My name is [Mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_(given_name)) which means "consecrated to the god Mars" or "to be warlike". Also worth noting that Book of Mark in the Bible is generally considered the oldest one (which doesn't mean most historically accurate).

I'll be honest and say that I don't know why my parents picked it but I like it. I don't know if I can be considered "warlike" but I've had this name for 45 years now and it's mine.
