The [Kentucky Ark](https://arkencounter.com/) is supposed to be an interesting place to visit, as long as you don't try to treat it like something serious.

But I haven't been able to bring myself to visit because I'm super annoyed by all of the tax breaks and incentives this company got from the State to build it.
