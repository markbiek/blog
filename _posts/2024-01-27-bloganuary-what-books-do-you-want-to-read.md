I have a habit (not good or bad, just a habit) of reading the same books over and over and over. But I also have a list of books that I'm working my way through. Some things have been on the list so long that I don't even remember what they are anymore. I keep the list as a spreadsheet in Google Sheets.

The next book will definitely be "Beasts of Extraordinary Circumstance" by Ruth Emmie Lang. The CEO of our company recently recommendeded "Reboot: Leadership and the Art of Growing Up" by Jerry Colonna. I don't usually read that sort of thing but it seems intriguing so I'd like to try it out.

I read "The-Body Problem" by Cixin Liu last Fall and it was wonderful. The next two books in the trilogy are high on my list.

So many books, so many possibilities!
