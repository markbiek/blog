The first thing would be to set up an LLC/trust so nobody knows we won!

I like working so I wouldn't quit my job or anything. Maybe pay off our house?

We're super fortunate in our lives. There isn't much we want or need. It'd be nice to be able to use some of the money to improve our local community. Setup free day cares, pay for people to go to school, help with housing. All the things that taxes on rich people _should_ be doing already.

It'd also be nice to have some generational wealth to pass along so I'd try set things up for that. If we have grandkids, pay for them to go to college.
