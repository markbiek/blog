I'm not really into sports at all but my sons both are (football and futbol respectively). Even though I don't follow either, it makes for fun discussions. They tell me about the teams and players they're interested in. They get to tease me when I don't know something basic. It's all lovely.

My wife and I used to play one-on-one basketball a lot in college but we had to stop because the games got too competitive and rough. We're normally super chill but, for some reason, our games got real rough. We switched to tennis instead. It's better to have some physical separation and a net in between us ðŸ˜œ. We haven't played in a long time ago, though I'd love to start again.
