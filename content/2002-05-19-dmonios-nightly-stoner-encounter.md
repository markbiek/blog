_An intrepid Domino's Customer Service Rep answers the phone only to find himself speaking with the most stoned of stoners_
CSR: Thank you for calling Domino's, this is Antelope Love Fan. How can I help you?
MSS: Uhhhh, yeah. Do you have Coke or Pepsi products?
CSR: We have Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite, and Barq's Rootbeer.
MSS: Uhhh, hold on.
_Insert 3 minute pause with muffled whispering in the background_
MSS: Okay, uhhh. We want 2 Pepsis.
CSR: Will Coke be okay instead?
MSS: Oh yeah. That's totally fine.
_CSR raises loaded pistol to forehead and inserts cynanide capsule between teeth_
