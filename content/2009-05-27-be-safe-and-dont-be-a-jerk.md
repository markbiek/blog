#### Mark's (incomplete) Guide to Riding in Traffic

</p>

There is a conversation that I have over and over again in various
forms. It goes something like this:

PERSON: You ride your bike to **work**?

ME: Yesssss....

PERSON: How far is it?

ME: About 10mi.

PERSON: TEN MILES!?!?!

ME: It's pretty flat most of the way

PERSON: But how do you ride? There are no bike paths.

ME: I usually just take surface roads in the most direct route I can.
There are a couple of shortcuts I take to avoid particularly annoying
intersections.

PERSON: You ride on **THE ROAD**!?! Like with cars and stuff !?!

ME: Ummm, yeah.

Most people think nothing of driving everywhere but are completely
terrified of the possibility of riding a bicycle in traffic.

Guess how many fatal bicycle crashes there were in 2007?

<p>
> ### \~700^\\ [1][]^

</p>

Let's compare that to the

<p>
> ### *\~37,000*

</p>
fatal motor vehicle crashes there were in 2007.

The other thing to keep in mind is that 700 number includes all of the
people who were doing stupid things like riding without a helmet down
the wrong side of the road in the dark with no lights. So I think we can
stop quibbling about safety and start talking about how YOU TOO can
learn to ride in traffic without constant fear of death or injury.

### Gear

</p>

-   **Helmet**. This is the \#1
-   (in case you missed it) **HELMET**. In many cases, a bicycle
    fatality can be turned into a bicycle injury accident just by
    WEARING A HELMET.
-   **Bright clothing** and/or **Reflectors**
-   **Flashing lights** if you're riding in low-light conditions. Make
    sure you have lights for front and back. I have [one of these][] for
    the front and [one of these][2] for the rear.
-   **Rear-view mirror**. While not required, one of these can be
    helpful when changing lanes and keeping an eye on traffic behind
    you. There are [glasses mounted][] and [helmet mounted][] varieties.
    </p>

</p>

This next area focuses on **how** you ride. Obviously how you ride is
important for safety reasons. But it's also important because, when
you're out on the road, you're representing **all cyclists**. Every bad
interaction you have is a black mark against all of us. That person will
be less and less forgiving and considerate each time they come across a
cyclist in the future.

### Follow the Rules of the Road

</p>

-   DON'T ride on the sidealk.
-   DON'T ride on the wrong side of the road.
-   DON'T run red lights and stop signs.
-   DON'T weave in and out of traffic.
-   DO signal your turns.
-   DO obey lane designations. That means turn left from the left lane,
    respect right-turn and left-turn only lanes, etc.

</p>

Part of the reason for the bad blood between so many cyclists and so
many drivers is the erratic behavior of many cyclists. That means
drivers don't know how a cyclist is going to behave in any given
situation which leads to misunderstandings and frustration all around.

There are few other strategies that I use to establish my space on the
road.

### Ride in the lane, not on the shoulder

</p>
![Ride in the lane to the left of the shoulder][]

I usually ride 6" - 12" **into the lane** rather than riding on the
shoulder. This may feel counterintuative since you're out in traffic
even more but I've noticed a big shift (for the better) in how cars
behave towards me since I started riding this way. Being out a bit in
the flow of traffic forces cars to be more aware of you and give you a
reasonable about of room when passing.

### Watch your line

</p>
I see this behavior a lot, especially in residential neighborhoods. A
cyclist is riding up a street with lots of parked cars. Everytime the
cyclist gets to a large gap between the cars, they move over closer to
the curb. When the gap ends, they move back out to go around the next
set of cars.

This is **dangerous**. You're essentially having to merge back into
traffic over and over again and you're decreasing your visibility at the
same time.

My preferred strategy is to pick a line that avoids all parked cars and
maintain that line, and here's the important part, **even when I have
room to my right.**

![Don't zig-zag around cars][]

Another example would be a road that has three lanes but the right lane
changes to right-turn-only after a block or so. My approach is to ride
down the middle lane rather than having to merge out of the right-hand
lane as I get closer to the light. It does mean I have cars passing me
on the right and the left but I still feel safer with that than making
an extra lane-change.

### Don't be a jerk

</p>
Here's the scenario. You're riding down the road and someone passes you,
way too close, honking and yelling. What's your first instinct? Shout
something back? Flip them off? I know that's my overwhelming urge but
it's better for everyone if you can take a deep breath and let that
righteous anger go.

Conversely, if a car does something nice, wave! Smile! If you're in a
situation where they'll be able to hear you, throw a "Thank you!" their
way. If you screw up because you weren't paying attention,
**apologize**. I spaced out on a ride the other day and had a close call
with a very nice man crossing the street. He clearly had the
right-of-way so I stopped and apologized profusely for my mistake.

It's all about trying to build up a healthly relationship between
cyclists, cars, and pedestrians where everyone can be safe and get where
they're going.

Do be safe. And don't be a jerk.
