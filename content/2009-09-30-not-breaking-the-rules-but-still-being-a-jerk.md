For those of you who don't know, [StackOverflow][] is a programming
question-and-answer site and the first site in the [League of Justice][]
of sites running the StackOverflow Engine.

The premise is pretty simple. People go to the site and ask and/or
answer questions about programming.

There's also a reward system where good questions and answers get voted
up and bad questions/answers get voted down. If something you wrote gets
voted up, you earn reputation points. The more reputation you earn, the
more [privileges][] you get on the site. There are also XBox-Live-style
[Badges][] awarded for various, generally positive, behaviors.

The whole experience can be quite addicting and the quality of
information on the site is pretty high.

Lately though, I've started noticing a lot more of a specific,
unfortunate, behavior type. My favorite term for this type of person is
a [help vampire][]. I'm sure everyone is familiar with the basics. The
endless questions with no sense of appreciation for those answering. The
overbroad, do-all-the-work-for-me, attitude.

I believe that, in general, people want to help other people. There's no
way that StackOverflow could succeed if that wasn't true.

When I'm answering questions on StackOverflow, there are a couple of
things I look for (and that I try to do myself, when asking questions).

#### \#1 That the person asking the question is putting in some effort.

</p>
That means asking a specific question that can actually be answered.
That means no questions like "How do I write a chatroom in C\#?".

#### \#2 Some small indication that the person asking the question
**appreciates** that they are getting help.

</p>
In the case of StackOverflow, that means voting up answers you like and
[accepting][] your favorite answer.

I'm going to go ahead and pick on a specific user who is a fantastic
example of all the negative behaviors I've been talking about.

I have some screenshots of the profile statistics from about a week ago.

***461 questions asked*** and only 7 upvotes. That means, out of **all**
the answers to all 461 questions, this guy only found 7 answers worth
voting up.

Take a look at [any question][] to see his "Accepted Answer" rate. Of
those 461 questions, he's only found the answer he was looking for 39%
of the time.

I'm happy to see that, currently, his account has been suspended.

There's nothing wrong with asking lots of questions but there's a right
way to do it and a wrong way. And it doesn't get more wrong than this
schmoe.
