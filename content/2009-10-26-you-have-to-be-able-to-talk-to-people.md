One of the more important developer skills is the ability to work on the
same code-base that other developers are also working on, potentially
even at the same time.

What does it take?

-   Communication. Talk to the other people on your team. Document your
    stuff. Make plans about who's going to do what. The worst thing you
    can do is [go dark][].
-   Awareness. What sort of ripple affects are changes going to have?
-   Organization. You need to know what changes need to be made and
    who's going to make them.

I was loosely involved with a major site redesign at work and ended up
working simultaneously with the primary developer on a couple of
different occasions.

Here's how we handled it.

-   A Google spreadsheet with the change list (or sometimes printouts
    with change-sets) so we could divide things up easily. I'd
    eventually like to get some sort of [issue tracking][] software up
    and running but what we're doing works for now.
-   Version control. Essential to see what's changed and who changed it.
-   Instant Messaging so we could quickly communicate which area of the
    code we were working in to avoid overlap. I found IM to be just as
    fast as communicating verbally and less disruptive.
