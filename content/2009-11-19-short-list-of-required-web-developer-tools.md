While there are plenty of more [comprehensive lists][] out there, there
are a few tools I use for web development on a daily basis that are
worth talking about.

* * * * *



#### [Firebug][]


The number one is obviously Firebug. Doing web development without is
like developing with a rock on an etch-a-sketch.

Some favorite features

-   Easily [print messages][] to the Firebug [console][].
    
    
-   View (and even modify) HTML and CSS in a nice structured way.
-   View network activity and page speed using the **Net** panel. You
    can get more page speed information using [YSlow][] or
    [PageSpeed][].



* * * * *



#### [FirePHP][]


FirePHP is a plugin for Firebug that lets you log messages to the
Firebug console using server-side PHP calls. Fantastic for simple
debugging. SixRevisions has an [excellent guide][] on setting it up.

#### [Web Developer tools][]


This is another must-have with too many features to list. Some of my
favorites are:

-   Easily clear domain, url, & session cookies for the current page.
-   Turn styles on and off.
-   Automatically populate HTML form fields.
-   Lots of information about how elements are rendering on the page.



* * * * *



#### [Html Validator][]


A handy Firefox add-on that automatically validates the HTML of a page.
It also improves Firefox's "View Source" interface.

* * * * *



#### [Screen Calipers][]


Nice, stand-alone desktop app for measuring pixel distance.

#### [ColorPic][]


Great desktop app from [Iconico][] for picking colors from the screen.
Also handy as a general purpose screen-zoom tool.

I'm sure people out there have their own favorite tools and I'd love to
hear about them.
