This poem was written by a girl I knew in high school, in the winter of
1993. I periodically come across the card with the original draft of the
poem written in it and it never ceases to thrill me.

I look forward to the day when my daughter is old enough to appreciate
it.

> I don’t giggle, I laugh

> I don’t glow or perspire, I sweat.

> I am not going to make your tea when you order me to

> I walk, unless I saunter, but I always step meaningfully
>
> I drink my beer from a can

> and when I smile at you, take me seriously

> ‘cause I only smile when I want to.
