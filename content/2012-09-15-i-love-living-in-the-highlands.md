Jane and I were walking up Bardstown Rd. yesterday, heading for the
Mid-City Mall.

There was a pretty sketchy lady sitting at the bus stop near Eastern
Pkwy. As we passed, she asked "Are you waiting for the bus?".

"No, sorry" I said, figuring she was going to ask about the bus schedule
or something.

As we walked away, she hollered at me "I wouldn't suck your dick if my
life depended on it!"
