I'm attempting to hack my eating habits into shape over the next month.
What I'm doing isn't a new idea (and I can't remember the exact term for
it) but here's the gist.

I've made a contract with a friend of mine outlining certain rules for
my eating habits. If I break any of the rules, I have to give him money.

## The Contract

</p>

Time period: The contract runs from 11/5 - 11/30. Depending on how it
goes, I may ask for a renewal.

How it works: There is a list of rules below. If I break any of the
rules, I will pay you $10 for each transgression, up to $50 in a single
day.

## The Rules

</p>

-   No eating candy of any kind ever.
-   No eating sweets or dessert (see exceptions below).
-   No eating any food purchased from a gas station or fast food
    restaurant.
-   No eating chips other than tortilla chips.
-   No eating dry or honey roasted peanuts.
-   No eating peanut butter or nutella directly from the jar.
-   No eating pizza unless Jane made it.
-   No eating between 8pm and 5am.

</p>

## The Exceptions

</p>

-   One cheat day per week. This means I can eat late and have bad food.
    But I'm still not allowed to eat any kind of candy.
-   I'm allowed to have a piece of pie on Jane's birthday. This is an
    explicit exception because her birthday is on Wed and I'm planning
    to have my cheat day on Fri.
