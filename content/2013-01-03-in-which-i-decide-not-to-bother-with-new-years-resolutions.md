My wife & I had an interesting conversation about New Year's Resolutions
a few days ago and we both came to the same conclusion.

We're not making any this year.

It all started when we were complaining about how crowded the gym is
going to be for the next 3-4 weeks. All of the New Year's Resolution
folks will flood the place. Then, when they've used up all of their
motivation, things will thin out again.

Now I'm well aware of things that I plan to change about myself. Some of
them are new, some are things I've been working on for a long time.

There are things I want to do and things I want to stop doing.

But I've decided I'm not going to use January 1 as an arbitrary start
date for any of them.

I am a work in progress.

At any time I choose, I can do things and change things.
