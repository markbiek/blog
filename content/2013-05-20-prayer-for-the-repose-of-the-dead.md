I saw this inscribed on an Egyptian tomb in the Field Museum in Chicago:

> O, all ye who pass by here may you recite this offering for the repose of the souls of those here:
>
> An offering which the King gives of
> a thousand of bread, a thousand of
> beer, a thousand of fowl, beef, linen
> and of every good and pure thing
> upon which a vindicated soul may live.
