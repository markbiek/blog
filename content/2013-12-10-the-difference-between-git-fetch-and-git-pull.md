My friend [Brad](https://twitter.com/bradleycorn) wrote this explaination of the difference between `git fetch` and `git pull`.

**`git fetch`**
>> Pull down everything from the server *BUT DO NOT MESS WITH MY WORKING DIRECTORY!*

**`git pull`**
>> Pull down everything and *I DON'T GIVE A CRAP WHAT'S IN MY WORKING DIRECTORY. GIVE ME THE GOODS.*
