Ever run into the SSRS Report Builder error `The definition of the report 'XYZ' is invalid.`?

Ever been _really_ annoyed by how useless and unhelpful that error is?

Well, there's a simple way to get the Report Builder to cough up some more details about the error.

Just **click on the `Preview` pane for the report** and it'll show you the exact error message which, while opaque, is at least something you have a chance of Googling.

Why the Report Builder won't give you the detailed error in the Error List is beyond me.
