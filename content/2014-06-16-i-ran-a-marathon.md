Last Monday, [I ran a marathon](http://www.strava.com/activities/151766921).

I came home from work, packed as much water as I could and set off. 5:18:45 later, I had run 26.2 miles.

It was slow going and I was hot and in a lot of pain for the last bit of it.  But I also experienced a moment of pure joy and transcendence at mile 23.

I was running down Beargrass Rd from Cherokee Park. It was almost 10pm, pitch black and I had no lights. 

There was no one around and I ran in complete silence surrounded by the blinking lights of a thousand fireflies. They were all around me. Along the ground, in the bushes, up in the trees. It was like the stars had fallen.

A tiny moment of peace that let me ignore my cramping legs and stomach to soldier on.
