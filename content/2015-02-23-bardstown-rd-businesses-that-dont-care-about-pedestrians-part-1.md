Yesterday afternoon, I walked from the Mid-City Mall back to Kroger down the East side of Bardstown Rd and I was shocked by how miserable an experience it was.

First I want to thank the business that did make the effort to clear the entire sidewalk in front of their buildings.

Sadly, very few businesses have shoveled at all. And, of those that _did_, most just shoveled from their parking lot to the front door leaving huge sections of the sidewalk impassable.

Here's a long list of businesses that didn't shovel on the East side of Bardstown Rd.
