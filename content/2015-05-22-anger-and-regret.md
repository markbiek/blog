I was an angry little kid. From the ages of about 4-9, I would have inexplicable fits of rage.

I remember destroying my room. Breaking favorite toys and then crying with regret.

We had, for a short time, an orange tree in the back yard.

There was a portion of the deck that curved and the tree was in the grass directly in front of the curvature.

It only bore fruit once and, in a fit of rage, I tore off all three oranges and threw them into the woods behind our house.

Not long after, the tree died and my dad dug it up.
