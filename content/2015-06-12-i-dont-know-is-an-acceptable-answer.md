I know so many people, especially in the software industry, with an extreme aversion to saying I dont know.

Theyd talk nonsense in circles before admitting that they didnt know the answer to a question.

That mentality makes no sense to me.

If you know everything, then you dont have anything else to learn and then youre done. Whats the point?

Just say I dont know what that is!, be excited to learn something new, and lets go!
