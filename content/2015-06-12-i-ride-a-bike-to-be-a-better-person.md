I am the worst person I can be when Im behind the wheel. Which is when Im at my most dangerous. When youre driving, thats when you need to be the most compassionate and responsible of any other time in your life because you are driving a weapon.  Louis CK

The above applies so perfectly to me. I become a horrible person when I drive.

Im impatient.

I take everything personally.

I assume the worst about everyone.

Minor delays drive me crazy.

So I bike instead.

Im calmer when I bike and its easier to let things go. Getting somewhere always takes the same amount of time so I dont have to rush.

I get to be outside and I usually arrive at my destination happy.
