### Journalism is dead

The 24-hour news cycle has replaced true reporting with sensationalism and fear-mongering.

Discourse has been replaced by a shouting contest. Whoever is the loudest wins.

The mainstream media is too tied up with politics to ask for any accountability from anyone.

The majority of reporters are vultures who feed on fear and human misery, scrabbling like rats for a scrap of air time.

Our only hope are the independent journalists. The small-time people online who are still willing to dig deep.
