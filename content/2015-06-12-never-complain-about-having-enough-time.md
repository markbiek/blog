### Never complain about having enough time

https://flic.kr/p/ugZeY

People are constantly saying, Oh, I wish I could do xyz but I just dont have enough time.

Or Im behind on xyz. There just wasnt enough time.

And I get it. Everyone has things going on.

You work full-time, youre married, you have kids, whatever it is.

The thing is, you have time for the things that you make a priority. You wouldve had enough time to do xyz if youd made it a priority.

But you didnt. You chose to do other things instead, which is perfectly fine.

But you dont get to complain about not doing xyz any more.

You either decide how committed you are to xyz and do it.

Or you let it go.
