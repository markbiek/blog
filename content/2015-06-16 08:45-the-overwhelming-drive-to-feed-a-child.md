Lots of different urges kick in when you have kids, like the urge to feed them.

Thats why it drives you so crazy when they wont eat.

Intellectually, you know they arent going to starve. But theres something deep in the animal part of your brain that needs to feed them.

And its not just your own kids. Its any kids.

Ive lost track of the number of times, at the park or the pool or wherever, that some little kid has seen we have snacks and come over. And you just feed them, without hesitation!

When I first introduced my youngest to Minecraft, we played a network game together so I could show him how it all worked.

For those of you not familiar with the details of Minecraft, your character requires food periodically or you die.

So my son and I were playing and his character started to get hungry and I had an incredibly visceral reaction. My heart rate went up and I started to get very anxious. I didnt really calm down until Id managed to scrounge up some in-game food and feed his character.

Thats how deep the urge goes! Even in a video game!
