### Stories and thoughts

I had trouble when I started writing every day. I didnt have much to say so I shared stories from my past.

I kept writing but, every time I told a story, I felt like I was cheating. I felt like I had to have grand thoughts and ideas to share instead.

But Im over that now.

Telling stories is a great way to churn up the stuff in your head. Telling stories makes me think about things in new ways which makes me think which gives me more stuff to write about.

All writing is worthwhile.

All writing will lead somewhere if you let it.
