Slug: my-kids-are-terrible-at-knock-knock-jokes

How can you be bad at knock knock jokes? Theyre the simplest form of joke on the planet.

And yet, my kids are.

I loved knock knock jokes when I was little. I had a bunch of books and I spent hours reading and memorizing them.

> Knock Knock.

> Whos there?

> Luke.

> Luke who?

> Luke, Im standing on my head!

My kids dont do this. They just make things up. And from an avant-garde/dadaist sort of view, theyre probably brilliant, but theyre horrible to a purist like me.

> Knock Knock.

> Whos there?

> Poop.

> Poop who?

> I pooped on your head!

What is that?!? That doesnt work at all.

Luckily their appreciation of physical and absurdist humor is solid and they love sarcasm and wield expertly.

I guess you just cant win every parenting award.
