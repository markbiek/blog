### Bad teenage poetry #tbt

> I think this was written when I was 14 or 15. Clearly about a girl I was infatuated with, not sure who.

she is a soft girl
in appearance anyway
her eyes me
calm and soft
her skin smooth and soft
her fine hair bright and soft
she can make herself cry
and she looks beautiful
when she does so
with fake tears running
down
lightly blushed cheeks
and a hint of true sadness
shining through her deep blue eyes
i can see her soul in her eyes
i can see her soles in her feet
and what bright red lips that
i would like to taste
at least once
and to make her laugh is
such a good feeling
