I was at a YMCA summer camp sleepover when I had my first migraine. I got up to go to the bathroom, walked into the bathroom with it's harsh flourescent lights, and suddenly the room was swimming.

I saw floating colored lights as my vision shrunk down to a pinpoint, pain like my head had been bashed in with a rock, and then I was vomiting all over the room.

I'm assuming my parents had to come pick me up but I don't specifically remember. But I do remember telling my parents what had happened and they said "Sounds like you had a migraine".

Both my parents get them so I guess it was bound to happen sooner or later.

I don't get them much anymore. Maybe once or twice a year.

But there was a period around 2008 where I was getting them several times a month to the point where I went on daily medication for it. Exercise and a less stressful job seemed to help and I haven't taken the meds for a long time.

Everyone has different triggers. A few of mine are:

* Rich, dark chocolate desserts.
* People who have recently smoked.
* Thrumming sounds when its hot.

When I get a full-blown one, I see colored lights. I get tunnel vision. Loud noises translate into a bright flash of light in my face. And its the worst pain Ive ever experienced.

I wouldn't wish it on anyone.
