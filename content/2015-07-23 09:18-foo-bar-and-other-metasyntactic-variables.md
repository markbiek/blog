Anyone who deals with code for a living has come across foo or bar as a placeholder. You may have even cursed someone who used it as a permanent name, leaving you to decipher the intent.

A few more of you may have heard of, or even used, baz.

But it doesn’t end there!

The “standard” list for English is:

#### foo

Originally a nonsense word from the 1930s comic [Smokey Stover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokey_Stover) and a military shorthand for FUBAR in the 1940s, it gained popularity in computing with the Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT in the 1960s.

#### bar

Another shorthand for FUBAR from WWII.

#### baz

According to the [Jargon File 4'0](http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/b/baz.html), baz also origin[ates ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogo_(comic_strip))with the Tech Model Railroad Club and the Pogo character Albert the Alligator.

#### qux

A mutation of quux.

#### quux

Coined by American computer scientist Guy Steele. It can be used to imply that a point is not crucial (opposite of crux).

#### corge

Invented by Mike Gallaher, this gained popularity via the GOSMACS (first implementation of Emacs-in-C) documentation. May be based on the name of someone’s cat.

#### grault

See corge.

#### garply

Used by hackers at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL).

#### waldo

A mechanical device, like an arm, that is controlled by a human limb. They were originally developed for handling nuclear materials in the 1940s and named after the Robert A. Heinlein story of the same name. Popularized by [Tom Cheatham](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/04/thomas-edward-cheatham-jr/) and his students at Harvard.

#### fred

Popularized by its ease of typing as a variable name. May stand for Flipping Ridiculous Electronic Device in some circles.

#### plugh

A magic word from the adventure game [ADVENT](http://www.jar[gon.net/j](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure)argonfile/a/ADVENT.html), a precursor to Adventure.

#### xyzzy

Another magic word from ADVENT, it teleports the player between two locations.

#### thud

One of the canonical variables at CMU in the mid-1970s. Sometimes found preceeding blat.

And [other languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable) have their own commonly-used words too.

The etymology of Foo is fascinating in its own right. I wont duplicate the fine efforts of R[FC 3092 ](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3092.html)to document it.

Another weird little bit of computer history.
