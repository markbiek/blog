My mom has dropped a lot of wisdom on me over the years. I was too young and full of hubris to get most of it the first time around, but I sure appreciate it now.

It gives me hope that some of the things I hound my kids about will stick.

### There may be something more fun to do, but you still have to get up and go to class/work in the morning.

It could be sex, hanging out with friends, whatever. It’s OK to have fun but you still have to handle your business. It took flunking Computer Science 2 in college before this one sunk in.

### Whatever your job is, work hard and be good at it.

Maybe your job is filing things. Make a game out of it. See how fast you can be without making any mistakes. Whatever crap job you’re doing, try to be amazing at it. At the very least, it’ll be entertaining.

Once, when I was in middle-school, I gave someone a black & white picture I developed myself. My mom was helping me mat and frame it. I was going crazy because she kept making me take the whole thing apart and clean the glass because it had streaks or paper towel fuzz. She made me redo it at least 5 times.

Despite (or maybe because of) the aggravation of this (and other) situations, I still ended up with a decent work ethic.

### A little <insert vice> never hurt anyone.

Little is the key word. All things in moderation. This ties right back to item number one. Moderation is hard for me. But isn’t it for everyone? Sometimes not-doing is easier.

### We will always come and pick you up, no matter where you are or what you’ve done.

Done something stupid like gotten drunk or dropped acid? Doesn’t matter, we’ll come get you.

I never once had to take advantage of this offer but it sure felt good having it.

I will make the same promise to my kids.
