From 2006 to mid-2014, I wrote down as many of the bizarre things our kids did/said as I could. I haven’t been as dilligent about it lately and I’m starting to regret it.

Here’s a random sampling from the past:

> Stuart: “Daddy it’s dark outside. It’s nighttime”

> Me: “That’s right. It is dark outside.”

> Stuart: “Daddy? You turn the light on outside?”

> -2006

> “Do monsters have penises?”

> -Rina, 2006

> Jane: Sweetie, you’re not going to school because you’re sick.

> Stuart: Am I going to go to home with my friend you?

> -2006

> Stuart: “Mom, what if people were all chicken nuggets and the pool was the ketchup?”

> -2009

> “I’m not famous but I AM awesome.”

> -Ivar, 2010

> “I had one whole year of loneliness.”

> -Rina on the birth of Stuart, 2011

> “More hugging, less leaving.”

> -Ivar, as I was leaving for week, 2011

> Ivar: Can cowboys be blonde?

> Me: Yes sweetie. A cowboy is just a guy.

> Ivar: OK, good.

> -2012

> “Were pirates the first people on earth after cavemen?”

> -Ivar, 2012

> You can’t trim your Mustache. That’s the best part of a man.

> -Rina, 2014
