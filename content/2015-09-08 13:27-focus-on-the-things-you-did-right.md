It’s easy to get down on myself.

Some days, there’s a constant stream of self-doubt running through my head.

The best thing to do is counter each negative thought with a positive one.

“You were so slow this morning and you only ran 3 miles!”

“Yeah, but I ran 8 miles on Sat and I crushed it. Plus, I still dragged my ass out of bed and ran.”

“You got up in the middle of the night and ate a bunch of shit!”

“Yeah, but dinner last night was pretty wholesome.”

“You need to lose 30lbs!”

“That’s probably true. But I exercise and ride my bike to work every day. My blood pressure and resting heart rate are the lowest they’ve ever been and my biometric screening came back with awesome results. I feel good so I’m not going to stress about a number”

“You don’t spend enough time with your kids!”

“First of all, they’re at an age where they don’t want to spend as much time with me. I do lots of things with them and, most importantly, they like each other. That was always the priority. They’re good kids and I’m doing a good job.”

“You did something super stupid at work today!”

“Yeah, but I fixed it and I made notes so I don’t make the same mistake again.”

I refuse to let my brain sabotage me. Whatever my many flaws are, I’ve accomplished lots of things I’m proud of.
