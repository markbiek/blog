Yesterday, I wrote about the [new Costco ](https://medium.com/@antelopelovefan/where-s-the-new-bardstown-rd-costco-41268adaf926)coming to Bardstown Rd.

I’ve always wondered how much information was available about local properties and building projects. Finding out about Costco seemed like a good excuse to try and figure it out.

It turns out the city government has a ton of nice websites with all kinds of information.

#### Who owns a property?

The [Jefferson County PVA](https://jeffersonpva.ky.gov/property-search/) (Property Valuation Administrator) website is your one-stop to find out who owns a piece of property. You can also search by owner if you upgrade to a paid account.

(As an aside, my peeps at Via Studio designed that site and did a bangin’ job)

For example, there is an abandoned house at [630 East Breckinridge St.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/630+East+Breckinridge+St./@38.2401607,-85.7428559,3a,75y,192.39h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m4!1soCWxDWEpUk__NzWc6Fy12Q!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x8ea91153256857a1!6m1!1e1) that I bike past every day.

A [quick search](https://jeffersonpva.ky.gov/property-search/property-details/8200260/?StrtNum=632&Single=1) on the PVA website reveals Richards Investment Company LLC as the owner.

#### Need details of an LLC?

Hit the [Secretary of State website](https://app.sos.ky.gov/ftsearch/) to find out information about LLCs registered in Kentucky.

Here are the details for [Richards Investment Company LLC](https://app.sos.ky.gov/ftShOW/(S(sfa415qxrz243thcmmeoemu2))/default.aspx?id=07922[14&ct=06&cs=99999). ](https://app.sos.ky.gov/ftShOW/(S(sfa415qxrz243thcmmeoemu2))/ioffsearch.aspx?search=NANCY%20HERNANDEZ)Its neat because we see that Nancy Hernandez is the Organizer/Incorporator for a number of other LLCs as well.

#### Construction permits, Planning/Zoning Applications, etc

The city portal for Codes & Regulations has a [great search form](http://portal.louisvilleky.gov/codesandregs/mainsearch) where you can see all kinds of activity at a specific address.

You can also see lists of all [Planning Reports](ht[tp://portal.loui](http://portal.louisvilleky.gov/codesandregs/development-reports/buildingreports)svilleky.gov/codesandregs/planning-reports) and Building Reports (filterable by date/status/type)

There is a [mapping website](http://api.louisvilleky.gov/mapping/map?mapType=permits) which lets you map open permits of different types. This site only shows active building projects. Properties still in the planning phase wont show up here.

#### ALL THE DATA

Do you need more data? Well the [Louisville Open Data Portal](http://portal.louisvilleky.gov/service/data) has got you covered!

There is an amazing wealth of information here.

[Crime Data](http://portal.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/crimedataall-data)

[Bike Route Data](http://portal.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/bike-route-data)

[Animal Tag Data](http://portal.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/animaltag-data)

[Restaurant Inspection Scores](http://portal.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/restaurant-inspection-data)

The list goes on and on. And most datasets are downloadable as tab-separated or CSV for easy processing.

I didn’t have high hopes when I started researching Costco. I expected to have to make phone calls or visit government offices.

Kudos to the city for putting so much great data online.
