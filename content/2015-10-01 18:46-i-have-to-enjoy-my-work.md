I have to enjoy my work

I’ve known people who had zero problem working a shitty job that they hated. They could go in every day, do their shitty job and go home and leave it all behind.

In a weird way, I admire that ability because I can’t figure out the leave it all behind part.

When I hate my job, I’m miserable all the time. I can’t let it go. I eat like shit. My blood pressure goes up. I can’t sleep. It’s awful.

I wish I was strong enough to just suck it up but I can’t.

I don’t have to love my job. But I do have to like it.
