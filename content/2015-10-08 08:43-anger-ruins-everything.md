I’m sure everyone has been in this situation.

You’re in a meeting and it’s going badly. Maybe there’s one person in the meeting who’s derailing everything or causing unnecessary problems.

You’re sitting there and you can feel your blood pressure rising. Your heart is beating faster and faster and your face is flushing because you’re so pissed off about the whole thing.

Then, when it’s over, you’re still mad. And you can’t get anything done. You’re too flustered to concentrate. You just have to sit there and be mad or walk around until it passes.

It’s a terrible feeling.

I think the only solution is not to get mad to begin with it. Easier said than done though, right?

It’s something I aspire to. And I even succeed sometimes.
