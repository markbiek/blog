Sometimes, Jane asks why I did something a certain way and I don’t always have a good answer.

We were talking about writing and I was telling her about my plan for a post in the near future. I’ve got a huge outline written for this post and it’s divided into subsections with their own titles.

She made a comment about it being interesting how much organizational effort I was putting into this one post.

And she’s right to mention it because I usually don’t. Most of the time, I sit down with a rough idea and hammer something out. I’ll reread it and edit it a couple of times and then send it on its way.

Other times, I’ll compose an entire draft in my head on the ride to work. Then I sit down and write it from memory.

There’s something different about this post she’s talking about. Somehow, it needs this structure. I have strong feelings about it and I don’t completely understand them.

I get this all the time.

I’ll do something a certain way and I don’t know what my motivation is. Just that it feels correct to do it that way.

Maybe that means I’m bad a introspection.

But I don’t think it really matters as long as I’m happy with the outcome.
