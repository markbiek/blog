Good teams and good company culture are interconnected.

You can’t have one without the other.

You can put talented people together and they can do good work under any circumstances, at least for a while. But without out solid culture to support the team, it’s going to wither and shrink.

Good people will leave. People that should leave will stay. It becomes harder to get new people in.

The people in the group don’t gel properly and the team stagnates.

It works the other way too though.

Given the freedom and space to do so, a group of good teams will build and grow your culture. The first team in a company gets to help define it. They bring their enthusiasm and best practices to the table and set the standard for future groups.

In the end, it’s a chicken-and-egg problem. You can’t have one without the other.
