I’ve discovered the true secret to happiness and, because I’m a nice guy, I’m going to share it with all of you.

> Learn to get as much joy (or more) from the success of others as from your own.

That’s really all you have to do.

There are always going to be people who are better than you and people who are not better than you.

Be delighted when either of them succeed! Sometimes you can even help them do it.

Don’t be envious of the good thing that happens to your friend or co-worker or spouse. Feel joy for them as if you were feeling joy for yourself.

You’ll be amazed by how much lighter you feel.

How much harder it is to be sad, because something great is always happening somewhere.
