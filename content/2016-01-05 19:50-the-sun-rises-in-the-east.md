The back of the house I grew up in points North.

I could remember this when I was little because I could see Mt Shasta out the back window. It was one of the selling points of the house.

I was almost 6 when we moved so I don’t remember much about the move.

I remember that we had to leave our cat and her kittens behind.

I remember not understanding that the move was over and asking if I could take a bath in the new house before we went home. I was thrilled when I found out we were staying there.

Before moving to Louisville, that house was the longest I’d lived in one place. It came as a surprise to me when I realized I’d lived in Louisville for longer.

Every time I think of the sunrise, I picture the sky growing brighter and brighter out the right sliding door.

The back of the house faces North.

East is to the right when you’re facing North.

The sun rises in the East.
