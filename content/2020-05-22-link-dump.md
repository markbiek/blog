Dump of interesting stuff I read about this week:

## <a href="https://www.adminer.org/en/">Adminer</a>
Database management with a single PHP file. Think phpMyAdmin, but smaller.

## <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/animated-grainy-texture/">Animated grainy texture</a>
A neat little retro image animation.

## <a href="https://pestphp.com/">Pest PHP Testing Framework</a>
Built on top of PHPUnit, but it's a little tidier.

## <a href="https://www.blog.duomly.com/css-border-with-examples-tutorial/">CSS Borders</a>
A few interesting CSS border tricks.

## <a href="https://css.gg/">CSS Icons</a>
Like Font Awesome, but pure CSS. Real easy to grab just the icons you need
