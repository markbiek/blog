Dump of interesting stuff I read about this week:

## <a href="https://dev.to/thedamon/my-favourite-line-of-css-4klp">My favourite line of CSS</a>
A nice example of a fully responsive grid with no media queries.

tl;dr

`grid-template-columns: repeat( auto-fill, minmax(min(calc(180px + 12vmin), 100%), 1fr));`

## <a href="https://github.com/jaredpalmer/presspack">Presspack</a>
Toolchain for developing WordPress sites featuring:

* Modern JavaScript through Webpack
* Live reload via BrowserSync
* SCSS support
* Easy dev environments with Docker Compose
* Stateless, immutable plugin management via Composer
* Helpful HTML5 Router for firing JS based on WordPress page slug.

## <a href="https://css-tricks.com/timber-and-twig-reignited-my-love-for-wordpress/">Timber and Twig</a>
<a href="https://twig.symfony.com/">Twig</a> is Symfony's template language for PHP.

<a href="https://www.upstatement.com/timber/">Timber</a> is a WordPress plugin that helps connect WordPress and Twig.

The result is MAGIC!

You get a very Laravel-esque MVC approach to WordPress theme development.

## <a href="https://generatewp.com/">GenerateWP</a>
An online tool for generating common WordPress code-snippets.

## <a href="https://thorsten-hans.com/5-types-of-zsh-aliases">5 Types of ZSH Aliases</a>
A handy reference of different types of ZSH aliases.
