            "summary": "<p>I recently ran into a situation where I wanted Typescript to require a certain property, only if the <em>value</em> of a different property was a specific value.</p>\n<p>With some help from a <a href=\"https://github.com/acrobertson\">coworker</a> and some additional reading, I found a solution that uses a combination of <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#union-types\">Union</a> and <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#union-types\">Intersection</a> types.</p>\n<p>Let's say I have a couple of contrived objects like this</p>\n<pre><code>let a = {\n\ttitle: 'A title';\n\ttype: 'value';\n\tvalue: 'This is a value';\n};\n\nlet b = {\n\ttitle: 'Another title';\n\ttype: 'nothing';\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>What I want is for the property <code>value</code> to only be required when <code>type == 'value'</code>.</p>\n<p>To start, I declare a base type which contains the properties I always want to have:</p>\n<pre><code>type Base = {\n\ttitle: string;\n\ttype: 'value' | 'nothing';\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then I can declare intersection types for each possible value of the <code>type</code> property:</p>\n<pre><code>type ValueType = Base &#x26; {\n\ttype: 'value';\n\tvalue: string;\n};\n\ntype NothingType = Base &#x26; {\n\ttype: 'nothing';\n\tvalue: never;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>For <code>ValueType</code>, we inherit all of the type properties of the <code>Base</code> type but require a string <code>value</code> property when <code>type == 'value'</code>;</p>\n<p>For <code>NothingType</code>, we also inherit everything from <code>Base</code> but specify that the <code>value</code> property should never exist.</p>\n<p>Then we create a union type that we'll use on the actual objects we declare:</p>\n<pre><code>type MyType = ValueType | NothingType;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here are examples of objects that pass all of our type checks:</p>\n<pre><code>let good1: MyType = {\n\ttitle: 'This is a good object',\n\ttype: 'value',\n\tvalue: 'a value'\n};\n\nlet good2: MyType = {\n\ttitle: 'This is a good object',\n\ttype: 'nothing',\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>And here are some objects that throw type errors:</p>\n<pre><code>let bad1: MyType = {\n\ttitle: 'This is a good object',\n\ttype: 'value',\n\t// Here, we're missing the `value` property\n};\n\nlet bad2: MyType = {\n\ttitle: 'This is a good object',\n\ttype: 'nothing',\n\tvalue: 'another value'\n\t// Here, we shouldn't have a `value` property at all\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/C4TwDgpgBAQghgZ2gXigbwFAEhgEtgA2EAXFAsAE64B2A5gNzaiSkDkAbnAQK4StQAfKK2oB7YAAsatVowC+GDM2gA1LrwAq4FLETQAZOiba2nHn0ZYzvUuSp15jJdqgA5cVLpbIUVPCRQhpg4JsJiktKy2NYkUNQQ7BAU8orKUACyIN46aubZgm4e0tlORMBQtKKiACakmfmowXiEsawaUghQuJ1wFVXVUKIARgBWEADGwKwANMYswjEz0eqtvYsYcqUQ5UNw1QCMdVkujUz4RGzt3V09fTWDoxNTsyHzHCtLm4plULvVAExHBpGHDnVpXTrXXqVe7DMaTJavVrhTwyF4xNhwFFJKDrTZAA\">Typescript playground example</a></p>\n<h2>Update</h2>\n<p>The aforementioned <a href=\"https://github.com/acrobertson\">coworker</a> also showed me a nice way to do the same as the above using Interfaces which gives you slightly nicer error messages.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/JYOwLgpgTgZghgYwgAgEJwM4oN4CgCQYwYANhAFzIZhSgDmA3AWAJ4AOFyA5AG5wkBXCF2QAfbiAD2YABb0uTAL65coSLEQoAavyEAVdiggAPSCAAmGNJhzNDlXruFN8fQZ2q0QjXMtXhoeCRkADlpOW8DDmQTM0trLGQ8QntuNyEFAnTOEAgeaCUVVmiAWRYolABeZB13CrFQ8PoKplwyMGQ6SUlzSjL66uSiUk4uPTkrYCs4Tu7zZEkAIwArCAQwLgAaOw4HbK2spwcZ-d9WtogOxbhzAEY+8sNkQeZiMgdxqeQvma6ehZWaw22xSuzSTgOila7WQ13MACYHgMkq8Rh8Jt9prN-ktVusDqDRlJZPIQdljsSZNBkKcoUA\">Typescript playground example</a></p>\n",
