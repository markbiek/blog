            <description><![CDATA[<p>I was accessing a medical website the other day (using Firefox, my go-to browser since 2013) and I was greeted with this lovely popup.</p>
<p>I was immediately reminded of the bad old days when every other website (especially commercial ones) had this on them somewhere:</p>
<p>We're at a point where Google Chrome is currently the default browser for just about everyone. With Chrome having 65% of the browser market, nobody else is even close. The next highest is Safari (primarily from iPhone use) at 19%. Microsoft Edge is 5%, Firefox is 3%.</p>
<p>Let's be perfectly clear, this is not a good thing. The Free Software Foundation (who, yes, has their issues as an organization) has a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-google.en.html">great breakdown of why Chrome is so terrible from a privacy perspective</a>. There are <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%27google+chrome+is+spyware%27&#x26;t=ffab&#x26;atb=v354-1&#x26;ia=web">loads of other articles</a> saying the same things and more.</p>
<p>Multiple times a week, I try to access a website using Firefox and it doesn't work at all. Sometimes I can get it to work by disabling some of Firefox's privacy protections but I often have to pull out Google Chrome just to do what I need.</p>
<p>It's absolutely maddening because we've been here before with Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>Let's start at the beginning.</p>
<p>After numerous free trials of the walled-gardens of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL">AOL</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompuServe">CompuServe</a>, I got access to the open Internet in roughly 1992.</p>
<p>Our provider was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(online_service)">Delphi</a> and while it also had a walled-garden aspect to it, it also had general-use FTP, telnet, Usenet, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">Gopher</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web#History">web</a> was still in its infancy. There were a handful of places (Delphi) included offering limited text-based web access but I don't think I ever used it, sticking mainly to Gopher. Gopher was <em>awesome</em> and I spent hours going through different Gopher sites all over the world.</p>
<p>It's important to note that, at this point, everything was still text. Gopher didn't have images or any kind of styling. I wouldn't get to experience any kind of formatted HTML until I took a Human Computer Interaction psychology class in college.</p>
<p>At some point around in 1994, I got to start using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)">NCSA Mosaic</a> on various college computers. The next year brought access to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator">Netscape Navigator</a> which felt absolutely space-age in comparison to Mosaic.</p>
<p>From 1998 (IE4) until 2011 (IE9), Internet Explorer was the defacto browser for most people. Some sites didn't work in anything else. Other sites had popups encouraging you to use Internet Explorer. There were even sites that flat-out wouldn't let you access them with anything other than Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>Internet Explorer was terrible. It didn't work well, it was a security nightmare, trying to build websites for it was maddening because they didn't implement any of the standards properly. Talk to any web developer who had to support IE6 - IE8 and they will curl up into a little ball and start weeping.</p>
<p>I think I stuck with Netscape for personal use until the launch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox">Firefox</a> in 2004. But I started working as a software developer in 1998 and using Internet Explorer was pretty much a requirement in the business world, both using it and developing for it.</p>
<p>I did spend a couple of years using Google Chrome and I loved it at first. It was fast, tidy, rendered websites well, and wasn't quite the spyware monster that it is now.</p>
<p>I don't remember the exact year but, at some point, Chrome started trying to force you to sign into it with a Google account. As someone with multiple Google accounts (personal, work, etc), this quickly became a nightmare and I decided to give <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">Firefox</a> another try.</p>
<p>I was delighted to find how much faster it had gotten, how good the privacy controls were, how nice it was to use for development, and so on. I've been using Firefox ever since and it gets better with each iteration. There are versions for Android and iOS which are both great.</p>
<p>But I fear that we're rapidly approaching a world where it won't be possible to use Firefox (or any of the other smaller browsers like <a href="https://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> or <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a>.</p>
<p>We made so much progress after the decline of Internet Explorer. But now we've picked a new browser to break the web again.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>My biggest complaint is people being dumb (or not following the rules) in a way that's inconsiderate to everyone. Standing in an open doorway having a conversation with someone and blocking the way for everyone else. Driving and making illegal turns where people drift into the wrong lane. Driving and hanging out in the left lane on the freeway when they're slower than everyone else.</p>
<p>My absolute pet peeve is people who are inconsiderate to pedestrians and cyclists. I don't encounter much actual aggression anymore. Mostly it's just people not thinking or paying attention. A person who's turning right out of a parking lot and only looks left and almost runs you over because you're walking down the sidewalk from the other direction. People who don't stop when you're in the crosswalk.</p>
<p>I honestly think it's gotten worse since COVID started. COVID brought out this extreme self-centered-ness in a subset of our population and it's carried over into everything, especially driving.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm not really into sports at all but my sons both are (football and futbol respectively). Even though I don't follow either, it makes for fun discussions. They tell me about the teams and players they're interested in. They get to tease me when I don't know something basic. It's all lovely.</p>
<p>My wife and I used to play one-on-one basketball a lot in college but we had to stop because the games got too competitive and rough. We're normally super chill but, for some reason, our games got real rough. We switched to tennis instead. It's better to have some physical separation and a net in between us 😜. We haven't played in a long time ago, though I'd love to start again.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The first thing would be to set up an LLC/trust so nobody knows we won!</p>
<p>I like working so I wouldn't quit my job or anything. Maybe pay off our house?</p>
<p>We're super fortunate in our lives. There isn't much we want or need. It'd be nice to be able to use some of the money to improve our local community. Setup free day cares, pay for people to go to school, help with housing. All the things that taxes on rich people <em>should</em> be doing already.</p>
<p>It'd also be nice to have some generational wealth to pass along so I'd try set things up for that. If we have grandkids, pay for them to go to college.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I have a habit (not good or bad, just a habit) of reading the same books over and over and over. But I also have a list of books that I'm working my way through. Some things have been on the list so long that I don't even remember what they are anymore. I keep the list as a spreadsheet in Google Sheets.</p>
<p>The next book will definitely be "Beasts of Extraordinary Circumstance" by Ruth Emmie Lang. The CEO of our company recently recommendeded "Reboot: Leadership and the Art of Growing Up" by Jerry Colonna. I don't usually read that sort of thing but it seems intriguing so I'd like to try it out.</p>
<p>I read "The-Body Problem" by Cixin Liu last Fall and it was wonderful. The next two books in the trilogy are high on my list.</p>
<p>So many books, so many possibilities!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>One of my favorite family traditions was, when the kids were little, we used to walk to buy our Christmas tree. The grocery store across the street sold trees. We would all bundle up, get the wagon, and walk over and pick out our tree. We'd hoist the tree into the wagon and I would pull it home, usually with the tree resting against my back to keep it from falling over. Some years, we did it in the bright sun, some years it was dark and actively snowing. It was always so fun to live through the kid's excitement. We'd pick out the perfect tree and then some of us would stand outside and guard it while the others went inside to pay.</p>
<p>Another favorite tradition is our annual (sometimes twice-annual!) trip to the beach in <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/qNGaQ719X5ibdtT29">Hilton Head Island, SC</a>. We've been going there since before all of the kids were even born and we still go now. We hang out with my in-laws, go to the beach, ride bikes around, eat at the Salty Dog Cafe. It's all wonderful but the beach was one of my favorite places. I love to dig in the sand and build sandcastles. Even though they're practically grown, the kids still join me in digging. Our favorite game is to build a giant castle with a moat and wall just a little bit up the beach from the waves. Then we have to race the incoming tide to finish and see how long the castle survives. Sometimes, we do a good enough job that the remnants of the castle are still there the next day!</p>
