            <description><![CDATA[<p>After 25 years working as a software developer, I've been thinking a lot about the things that have been the most important over the course of my career. The interesting pattern I've noticed is that most of these things aren't unique to software development at all. You could easily apply them to just about anything.</p>
<h1>Curiosity is your friend</h1>
<ul>
<li>Always wonder about things.</li>
<li>Wonder how things work.</li>
<li>Wonder <em>why</em> they work the way they do.</li>
<li>Explore! Try to see things that other people aren't seeing.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Never stop learning</h1>
<ul>
<li>Fall in love with learning new things.</li>
<li>Fall in love with learning more about things you already know.</li>
<li>Get good at the process of learning so you can learn more things faster!</li>
</ul>
<h1>Communication is key</h1>
<ul>
<li>We don't do work in a vacuum. Being able to communicate your ideas to others is paramount.</li>
<li>Learn to writing clearly and simply.
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://fieldguide.automattic.com/the-automattic-style-guide/">Automattic Style Guide</a> is a good compilation of resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>"Programs are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute." - Donald Knuth</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Master your tools</h1>
<ul>
<li>Learn the ins and outs and full capabilities of your tools. Nothing makes work faster than efficient tool use.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs">Visual Studio Code docs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://vimhelp.org/">Vim help</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Collect keyboard shortcuts for all the programs you use. Make it a game where you lose points when you touch the mouse. Write the shortcuts on post-its stuck to your monitor to help you remember.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">AlfredApp</a></li>
<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236">OSX shortcuts</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Get good at the command-line. At a minimum, get comfortable manipulating files and strings from the cli.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview">Beginner's guide to the cli</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Get good at searching</h1>
<p>There's to much stuff to remember so you're going to spend a lot of time trying to find what you need.</p>
<h2>Searching for information</h2>
<p>Get good at searching the Internet.</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to be able to track down the source of error messages.</li>
<li>There will be things you don't know how to do and other people have already done them. Learn how to find those details!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Searching Code</h2>
<p>How do you know where the code you need to change lives? You have to search for it!</p>
<ul>
<li>Your editor probably has all kinds of fancy search tools. Learn how to use them.</li>
<li>Learn cli search tools (<code>grep</code>, <code>ack</code>, <code>ripgrep</code>, etc). There are lots of them.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://beyondgrep.com/">ack</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learn enough regex to make your searches more efficient.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://regextutorial.org/">Regex tutorial</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learn how to trace your way through code. Maybe you need to change the functionality of a button and you don't know where the code is. Start by finding where the button markup is, then trace your way back up through the code.</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I've always wondered if it's possible to write a PHP command-line script that launches an editor, lets the user type something, then reads in whatever they type (like a git commit log message).</p>
<p>Turns out, it's pretty straightforward with the <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/process.html#using-php-streams-as-the-standard-input-of-a-process">Symfony Process</a> component.</p>
<pre><code>&#x3C;?php

require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Symfony\Component\Process\Process;

// Create a temporary file so the user has something to type into
$edit_file = tempnam(sys_get_temp_dir(), "_log");

// Attempt to load the user's EDITOR from the environment. Default to vim otherwise.
$editor = getenv('EDITOR') !== false ? getenv('EDITOR') : 'vim';

// Launch the editor and open the temp file
// This will pause execution of our script until they save and close the editor.
$process = new Process(['vim', $edit_file]);
$process->setTty(true);
$process->run();

// Read back the data they entered.
$data = file_get_contents($edit_file);
echo "$data\n";

// Clean up after ourselves.
unlink($edit_file);

            <link>https://mark.biek.org//2021/11/using-jq-to-filter-json-by-regex</link>
            <guid>https://mark.biek.org//2021/11/using-jq-to-filter-json-by-regex</guid>
            <pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 16:04:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>If you're not already familiar with using <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> to manipulate JSON on the command-line, go download it immediately. While it can be a little tricky to learn at first, it'll make your life so much easier.</p>
<p>For example, I recently learned how to filter a JSON result set using a regex to match the value of a particular object property.</p>
<p>Let's say I have a JSON payload that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
	"total": 4,
	"domains": [
		{
			"id": 100,
			"account": 999,
			"name": "alice.com",
			"created": "2021-01-01 00:00:00"
		},
		{
			"id": 101,
			"account": 999,
			"name": "bob.com",
			"created": "2021-01-01 00:00:00"
		},
		{
			"id": 102,
			"account": 999,
			"name": "charlie.com",
			"created": "2021-01-01 00:00:00"
		},
		{
			"id": 103,
			"account": 999,
			"name": "eve.com",
			"created": "2021-01-01 00:00:00"
		}
	]
}
</code></pre>
<p>It's super easy to get all of the domain objects using the jq filter <code>.domains[]</code> and it's also trivial to get at only specific fields of each domain object (eg <code>.domains[] | {id,name}</code>).</p>
<p>Now let's say we want to only get the domain object where the name is "charlie.com".</p>
<p>That's where the <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#select(boolean_expression)">select()</a> and <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#test(val),test(regex;flags)">test()</a> functions come in.</p>
<p>We can use the following filter to accomplish 👆️:</p>
<p><code>.domains[] | {id,name} | select(.name | test("charlie"))</code></p>
<p><code>select</code> takes a boolean expression and, if that expression is true, returns that particular item. Everything else is filtered out.</p>
<p>The <code>test</code> function takes a regex (or simple string to match). In our particular case, <code>test</code> is checking against the <code>name</code> property of each object.</p>
<p>Now let's saw only want the <code>id</code> <em>value</em> of the object that matches our test.</p>
<p>We simply change our filter to the below:</p>
<p><code>.domains[] | {id,name} | select(.name | test("charlie")) | .id</code></p>

            <pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 00:42:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I recently ran into a situation where I wanted Typescript to require a certain property, only if the <em>value</em> of a different property was a specific value.</p>
<p>With some help from a <a href="https://github.com/acrobertson">coworker</a> and some additional reading, I found a solution that uses a combination of <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#union-types">Union</a> and <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#union-types">Intersection</a> types.</p>
<p>Let's say I have a couple of contrived objects like this</p>
<pre><code>let a = {
	title: 'A title';
	type: 'value';
	value: 'This is a value';
};

let b = {
	title: 'Another title';
	type: 'nothing';
};
</code></pre>
<p>What I want is for the property <code>value</code> to only be required when <code>type == 'value'</code>.</p>
<p>To start, I declare a base type which contains the properties I always want to have:</p>
<pre><code>type Base = {
	title: string;
	type: 'value' | 'nothing';
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then I can declare intersection types for each possible value of the <code>type</code> property:</p>
<pre><code>type ValueType = Base &#x26; {
	type: 'value';
	value: string;
};

type NothingType = Base &#x26; {
	type: 'nothing';
	value: never;
}
</code></pre>
<p>For <code>ValueType</code>, we inherit all of the type properties of the <code>Base</code> type but require a string <code>value</code> property when <code>type == 'value'</code>;</p>
<p>For <code>NothingType</code>, we also inherit everything from <code>Base</code> but specify that the <code>value</code> property should never exist.</p>
<p>Then we create a union type that we'll use on the actual objects we declare:</p>
<pre><code>type MyType = ValueType | NothingType;
</code></pre>
<p>Here are examples of objects that pass all of our type checks:</p>
<pre><code>let good1: MyType = {
	title: 'This is a good object',
	type: 'value',
	value: 'a value'
};

let good2: MyType = {
	title: 'This is a good object',
	type: 'nothing',
};
</code></pre>
<p>And here are some objects that throw type errors:</p>
<pre><code>let bad1: MyType = {
	title: 'This is a good object',
	type: 'value',
	// Here, we're missing the `value` property
};

let bad2: MyType = {
	title: 'This is a good object',
	type: 'nothing',
	value: 'another value'
	// Here, we shouldn't have a `value` property at all
};
</code></pre>

<p>The aforementioned <a href="https://github.com/acrobertson">coworker</a> also showed me a nice way to do the same as the above using Interfaces which gives you slightly nicer error messages.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://laravel.com">Laravel</a> models have a great feature called <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent-mutators#defining-an-accessor">Accessors</a>.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that you define a class method like this</p>
<pre><code>public function getFullNameAttribute() {
	return "{$this->first_name} {$this->last_name}";
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then doing something like <code>$myClass->full_name</code> actually executes the <code>getFullNameAttribute</code> function.</p>
<p>Obviously Laravel's model class is much more full-featured and can do a lot more.</p>
<p>That said, it's pretty easy to mimic Laravel's Accessor functionality.</p>
<p>The first piece is a simple <code>Str</code> class which turns <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case">snake-case</a> names into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case">camel-case</a> names. In a real Laravel application, you're better off using the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/helpers">Laravel Helpers</a>.</p>
<p>Then we're going to implement a simple <code>Model</code> class</p>
<p>Now we can create a simple <code>Person</code> class which extends our <code>Model</code></p>
<p>In this case, we have two public properties for first &#x26; last name and then we've defined a <code>full_name</code> accessor.</p>
<p>To tie it all together, we can use our new class like this</p>
<p>The above script will output</p>
<pre><code>First name: Mark
Last name: Biek
Full name: Mark Biek
</code></pre>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I'll admit that I have been pretty hit-and-miss with testing on projects over the course of my career. That said, I've been trying to be a little more consistent about it.</p>
<p>For Laravel projects, it's real easy since <a href="https://phpunit.de/">PHPUnit</a> integration is built into Laravel <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/testing">right out of the box</a>.</p>
<p>I also do a fair amount of WordPress and being able to unit test plugins and other functionality would be very handy.</p>
<p>While the setup is a little confusing at first, WordPress also comes with great tools for testing.</p>
<p>The official <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/misc/plugin-unit-tests/">WordPress testing documentation</a> is good and the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/scaffold/plugin-tests/">wp cli</a> can be used to build out most of the test scaffolding for you.</p>
<p>I also found these resources to be helpful</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://neliosoftware.com/blog/introduction-to-unit-testing-in-wordpress-phpunit/">Introduction to Unit Testing in WordPress</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wpmudev.com/blog/unit-testing-wordpress-plugins-phpunit/">Unit Testing WordPress Plugins with PHPUnit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.kirstencassidy.com/testing-wordpress-plugins-wp-cli-phpunit/">Testing WordPress Plugins with WP-CLI and PHPUnit</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But there's one thing I don't like about how WordPress handles testing.</p>
<p>They operate under the assumption that there will be a separate test database that gets completely wiped and reset each time the tests are run. While I understand the point behind, that approach doesn't work for a lot of my use-cases.</p>
<p>There are several projects with very large databases and it's easier and makes more sense for me to run the unit tests against my local development copy.</p>
<p>To that end, I've started a Github project: <a href="https://github.com/markbiek/wordpress-dev">https://github.com/markbiek/wordpress-dev</a> which is a clone of <a href="http://develop.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/">http://develop.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/</a>.</p>
<p>The only difference is, my version doesn't delete any data when the tests are run. We've just removed the contents of the <code>_delete_all_data</code> and <code>_delete_all_posts</code> functions in <a href="http://develop.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/tests/phpunit/includes/functions.php">functions.php</a>.</p>
<p>If you can, I'd recommend sticking with the official WordPress way of testing. But hopefully this will be useful to some other people.</p>
